Gimme a beat!
Sittin' in the movie show
Thinkin' nasty thoughts
Better be a gentleman or you'll turn me off
That's right, lemme tell it
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh, you nasty boys
I don't like no nasty girl
I don't like nasty food, oh yeah
The only nasty thing I like is a nasty groove
Will this one do?
Uh huh, I know... say...
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
