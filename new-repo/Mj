ackson has been referred to as the "King of Pop" for having transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation.[431] His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs.[432] Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, leading to the discontinuation of the album-oriented rock format previously dominant on the channel.[41][433] In songs such as "Black or White", "Heal the World", "Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice.[434][435] He is considered one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century,[436] and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life.
